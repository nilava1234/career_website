Hello it seems that you have found my github for my personal website
Welcome.


Here I have typed up a simple HTML and CSS websit with a little formating help from ChatGPT
I plan on expanding the career website as my skills with HTML increases and as I increase my
repertoire.

This will be an active reprentation of my professional career.

There is a github pages link associated with this page but I implore you to go through this link:
