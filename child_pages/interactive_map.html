        <p>
            This website was created as a personal project during my time with UT Outreach and is designed for
            logistical purposes for students enrolled in the course. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with
            JavaScript serving as the backend to handle button and map interactions. Overall, it is a straightforward
            website. I also plan to migrate it to either my Linux web server or my employer's web server, depending on
            the available access.
