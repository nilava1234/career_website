        <h1><b>Description</b></h1>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase and elaborate on my skills and projects that cannot be fully
            captured in my resume. It also includes links to my social media profiles, providing recruiters with
            additional insights about me. Initially, I created this site to enhance my HTML programming skills, but it
            has evolved into a passion project that allows me to experiment and grow my abilities further.

        <h1><b>Hosting + Development</b></h1>
        <p>This website is hosted on GitHub Pages, enabling me to modify and publish content from anywhere. GitHub
            handles all hosting and deployment, allowing me to update the site effortlessly by simply pushing changes.
            However, this approach does have some limitations. Specifically, it prevents me from using Flask, which
            restricts my ability to implement any backend functionality or create user-specific interactions, such as
            distinguishing between admin and general users.

        <h1><b>Website Prospects</b></h1>
        <p>I plan to continue using GitHub for its ease of access while hosting my server on a home Linux machine. I
            will run a script that checks my GitHub repository for updates in real-time, ensuring that the content is
            always current. This setup will allow for port forwarding, and I may also look into acquiring a domain to
            host the site. Additionally, Iâ€™m considering integrating it with my Discord bot, which is hosted on the same
            machine, to enable certain commands that keep the website up to date. This approach will help me reduce the
            cost of maintaining the website each year while also providing a personal server for my own use.
