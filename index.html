        <p class = "intro">
            Greetings,<br>
            <br>
            I am Nilava Saha, a dedicated undergraduate student enrolled at University of Texas at Austin, where I am pursuing my passion for Computer Science. 
            My academic journey started in the fall of 2021, and I am proud to have accumulated three years of experience in this field. I am committed to showcasing my skills and contributing to the industry.
            My proficiency extends across a diverse array of programming languages, demonstrating my skill set:<br>
            
            - Java: 5 Years of Experience<br>
            - C: 2 Year of Experience<br>
            - HTML: 1 Year of Experience<br>
            - C#: Less than 1 Year of Experience<br>
            - C++: Less than 1 Year of Experience<br>
            <br>
            In addition to these languages I have also worked with Assembly and ACL2. And having this large variety of
            langauges solidifies my confidence in learning a completely new system.

        <h2 class="header1">Professional and Acedemic Experience</h2>
        <p class = "intro">
            I collaborated with Walmart to facilitate and oversee monetary transactions between the company and its valued customers. In addition 
            to this role, I had the privilege of assuming managerial responsibilities on occasion, supervising a team of 8-12 colleagues while 
            temporarily filling in for managers and shift leads.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, during the summer of 2023, I took on the role of an educator, instructing a classroom of 20-23 students on STEM-related 
            subjects, including Electrical Engineering and programming. In tandem with teaching, I provided invaluable mentorship and guidance to these 
            students, offering assistance and support throughout their camp experience.<br>
            <br>
            These experiences have enriched my skill set and have allowed me to contribute meaningfully in both retail and educational contexts.
