        <p class = "intro">
            My name is Nilava Saha. I am an undergraduate student at UT Austin pursuing my passion for Computer Science.
            When it comes to programming experience I have 5 years of experience coding in Java, 1 year of C, 1 year of assembly, and now a little bit of HTML.
            I also have 4 years of workshop experience and 5 years 3d modeling and 3d printing.
            Making things has been my passion and interest since freshman year of high school and the STEM pathway helped scratch the itch to create. And I haven't stopped yet.
        </p>
        <h2 class="header2">Old and New Projects</h2>
        <p class = "intro">
            There are 2 main projects I am currently working on. This website which I plan on building up when I find the free time to do so
            and a 3d-printable foldable e-scooter that I can use at school. This website is extremely working in progress as you can see. But as I
            am evolving my skills in HTML I believe this website will grow too. Currently, I have implemented a parallax effect to the background image
            so it looks like the building is moving as you scroll. But adding a more professional background and image will make the website more appealing.
            Using HTML and CSS I was able to modify this website to my liking and even added a link to my linked-in as well as my resume which you can download.
            Additionally, I started on a creation that would allow me to make walking around on campus much easier and do it for cheap as well. Currently, I am
            making a foldable scooter that can be folded to fit in a water bottle holder. And I think I am able to do it.
            I do have many older projects as well. Like a vacuum breaker for your hose nozzle so it doesn't leak and many CS projects that had me working in assembly,
            C, managing an Operating System, etc. Feel free to ask.
        </p>
        <h2 class="header2">Professional and Acedemic Experience</h2>
        <p class = "intro">
            I am currently working at a Walmart providing exceptional customer service. Currently, I don't have time in the industry I have participated in a Robotics club
            where I used my understanding of Engineering and programming to create robots that can participate in the FIRST tech challenge. I lead the engineering division for an
            academic competition called Science Olympiad where I managed a group and people their tasks as well as managed finances and talent acquisition. I was also mentored by Deloitte
            during their Deloitte and students mentorship program where they broke down the needs and necessities of working in a work environment.
