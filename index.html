        <p class = "intro">
            Greetings,<br>
            <br>
            I am Nilava Saha, a dedicated undergraduate student currently enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, 
            where I am passionately pursuing my studies in Computer Science. Embarking on my academic journey in the fall 
            of 2021, I am proud to have garnered three years of invaluable experience in this dynamic field. My unwavering 
            commitment is directed towards showcasing my skills and making meaningful contributions to the industry.<br><br>
            Proficient across a diverse spectrum of programming languages, I bring a well-rounded skill set to the table:<br>
            
            - Java: 5 Years of Experience<br>
            - C: 2 Year of Experience<br>
            - HTML: 1 Year of Experience<br>
            - C#: 1 Year of Experience<br>

            In addition to these languages, I have also successfully worked with Assembly and ACL2. This extensive 
            repertoire of languages not only showcases my adaptability but also solidifies my confidence in quickly 
            grasping and mastering new systems.

        <h2 class="header1">Professional and Acedemic Experience</h2>
        <p class = "intro">
            I collaborated with Walmart to facilitate and oversee monetary transactions between the company and its valued customers. 
            In addition to this role, I had the privilege of assuming managerial responsibilities on occasion, supervising a team of 
            8-12 colleagues while temporarily filling in for managers and shift leads. This experience allowed me to contribute to the 
            seamless operation of the team and maintain high standards of customer service during transitional periods.<br>
            <br>
            
            Furthermore, during the summer of 2023, I assumed the role of an educator, instructing a classroom of 20-23 students on STEM-related subjects, 
            specifically focusing on Electrical Engineering and programming. In addition to teaching, I provided invaluable mentorship and guidance to these 
            students, offering assistance and support throughout their camp experience. This multifaceted role allowed me to contribute not only to their 
            academic development but also to their overall growth and enjoyment during the camp.<br>
            <br>
            These experiences have enriched my skill set and have allowed me to contribute meaningfully in both retail and educational contexts.
